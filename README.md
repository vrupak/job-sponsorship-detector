# LinkedIn Sponsorship Keyword Highlighter Extension

This Chrome extension highlights visa sponsorship-related keywords (e.g., H1B, Visa, Green Card) inside LinkedIn job descriptions. It works even when job descriptions are dynamically loaded without page refresh.

## Features

* Detects and highlights keywords like `H1B`, `visa`, `sponsorship`, `OPT`, `CPT`, etc.
* Detects companies that have sponsored visas in the past, based on the official USCIS 2024 H-1B Sponsor List.
* Displays a summary banner indicating detected keywords or absence of sponsorship terms
* Smart detection that refreshes highlights and banner when browsing between job listings
* Sunset Orange background with black text for keyword visibility
* Automatically works as you browse different job listings

## How It Works
